========

What does it can do?
The project intends to create a operation tool to manage distributed system or large-scals computer network.

Why create this project?
I was troubled by operating many servers (Linux Operate System) sinc working as an Engineer and a business administrator. To comfortable myself, I decided to create a tool to manage these manchines in batch.
Firstly, I create a project named "PowerFTP" which can upload file to and delete file from remote servers simply like operating single machine.

1. You can operate the whole node of computer network just as operating one machine.
2. Just execute command "./matrix" under the Matrix Entry directory,  you can enjoy the convenience of computer network operation.
3. Inputting the daily using command to manage your computers.
